# ProfessionShoppingList
A World of Warcraft AddOn that adds a shopping list for tracked recipes.

Profession Shopping List is an AddOn that allows you to track recipes, and shows you the materials you need to craft them.
It does not replace the profession windows, it only adds a few buttons and two tracking windows: one for the materials, and one for the recipes.

This AddOn is still in development and I am not an experienced programmer.
Feel free to give me advice on how to improve this AddOn and please report any issues to the Github (which I am also still familiarising myself with).
